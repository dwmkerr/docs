# OpenShift

At a high-level, OpenShift is Red Hat's 'platform as a service' offering. It is essentially Kubernete's with some additional features on top, such as Jenkins clusters for building, the facility to trigger builds from source changes etc.

## Flavours

Confusing no?

- OpenShift Origin: Open source, community and RH maintained. Can be installed for free.
- OpenShift Enterprise: A few versions behind, bullet proofed by RH. Expensive.
- OpenShift Cloud: Enterpise, on the cloud, subscription based.

## Getting Started

1. Read the Architecture Overview: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/index.html#architecture-index
2. If you don't know Kubernetes, learn Kubernetes first (at least the basics)
3. Actually set up OpenShift on some VMs. Two choices here, try [Installing OpenShift Origin with Ansible on AWS](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/configuring_aws.html) OR try installing OpenShift Enterprise on VMs. There's a good Udemy course on [Installing and Configuring OpenShift Enterprise](udemy.com/openshift-enterprise-installation-and-configuration/)
